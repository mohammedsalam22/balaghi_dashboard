// Re-export from ThemeContext for backward compatibility
// Components should use usePalette() hook instead for theme-aware colors
export { lightPalette, darkPalette } from './shared/contexts/ThemeContext'

// Note: The theme is now created dynamically in ThemeContext
// This file is kept for backward compatibility with existing imports
